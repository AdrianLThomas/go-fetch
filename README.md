Goes to Spotify and pulls back details on an artist of your choice, and displays an ASCII art image of the artist.

Using this exercise to build my very first Golang app, after having completed [A Tour Of Go](https://tour.golang.org/).

# Getting started
```
$ go run main.go --help
Usage:
  -artist string
        Artist name to lookup
  -token string
        Auth token to use for query
```

# TODO
- Write some tests
- Setup build (run tests, linting and other go quality tools)
